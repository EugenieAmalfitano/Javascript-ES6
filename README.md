# Javascript-ES6
Based on Pluralsight Class Object-oriented Programming in JavaScript - ES6

Here are some tips to set up the environment: 
- I ran it in VS Code (availabe here -- https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Open this project's folder in VS Code
- VS Code Shift-Ctrl-C -- puts you in the right folder inside VS Code to run NPM init <package>

NPM commands: 
- npm run dev -- will setup sync with the browser so that when you save a change, it immediately transpiles and you can see your changes in the browser.
- npm init drones (name of package)
- npm install -save es6-module-loader traceur
- npm install -save npm install -save-dev lite-server
- npm install -save material-design-lite

On my system, jquery was already installed because I have TypeScript. 
Otherwise: 
- npm install -save jquery
- npm install -save systemjs  (for compatibility with jquery which was older than es6) -- I don't think I needed this.
